# Settings & Connection Hooks

A reference for every Settings section and for connection hooks — the commands,
scripts, or Lua snippets DBFlux runs around a connection's lifecycle.

Open Settings from the command palette (**Open Settings**) or the sidebar. The
window is organized into sections down the left side.

| Section | Covers |
|---------|--------|
| [General](#general) | App-wide behavior: theme, startup, refresh, query safety. |
| [Audit](#audit) | What the audit log captures and how long it's kept. |
| [Keybindings](#keybindings) | Browse the keymap (read-only). |
| [Auth Profiles](#auth-profiles-proxies-ssh-tunnels) | AWS SSO / shared-credentials profiles. |
| [Proxies](#auth-profiles-proxies-ssh-tunnels) | SOCKS5 / HTTP proxy profiles. |
| [SSH Tunnels](#auth-profiles-proxies-ssh-tunnels) | Reusable SSH tunnel profiles. |
| [Services](#services-rpc) | External RPC drivers and auth providers. |
| [Hooks](#connection-hooks) | Reusable connection-hook definitions. |
| [Drivers](#drivers) | Per-driver overrides and settings. |

MCP-related sections (Clients, Roles, Policies) appear only when the binary is
built with the `mcp` feature; see [AI + MCP Integration](MCP_AI_INTEGRATION.md).

## General

### Appearance

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Theme** | Dark, Mirage, Light | Dark |
| **Style** | Default, Compact | Default |
| **Language** | System, then every language with a shipped translation catalog | System |

The language list is derived from DBFlux's shipped translation catalogs: English
appears first, followed by the remaining languages in deterministic order and
shown by their native names. System follows your OS locale and falls back to
English when no shipped locale matches unambiguously. A language change takes
effect after you restart DBFlux, so the control shows a permanent note to that
effect. Partial catalogs fall back to English for untranslated general UI text.
This release only translates the General section; the rest of the UI is being
converted crate by crate and stays in English for now.

### Startup & session

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Restore session on startup** | On | Reopen the tabs you had open last time. |
| **Reopen last connections** | Off | Reconnect to the connections that were active. |
| **Default focus** | Sidebar | Where focus lands on launch (Sidebar or the last tab). |
| **Max history entries** | 1000 | Query-history cap (minimum 10). |
| **Auto-save interval (ms)** | 2000 | How often editor buffers auto-save (minimum 500). |

### Refresh & background

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Default refresh policy** | Manual | Manual or Interval auto-refresh for data views. |
| **Default refresh interval (seconds)** | 5 | Interval used when the policy is Interval (minimum 1). |
| **Max concurrent background tasks** | 8 | Cap on simultaneous background work (minimum 1). |
| **Pause auto-refresh on error** | On | Stop auto-refreshing a view after it errors. |
| **Auto-refresh only if tab is visible** | Off | Skip refreshing tabs you're not looking at. |

### Execution safety (dangerous-query confirmation)

These three settings govern how DBFlux treats risky queries across **all**
drivers and query languages. There is no per-database toggle — the same rules
apply to SQL `DELETE`/`DROP`/`TRUNCATE`, MongoDB `deleteMany`/`drop`, Redis
`FLUSHALL`/`FLUSHDB`, and so on.

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Confirm dangerous queries** | On by default; show a confirmation before running a dangerous query. Turn off to allow them without prompting. |
| **Require WHERE for DELETE/UPDATE** | On by default; treat a `DELETE`/`UPDATE` with no `WHERE` as dangerous. |
| **Always require preview (ignore suppressions)** | Off by default; force the confirm/preview modal even for queries you previously chose to stop confirming. |

### Storage (Nightly builds only)

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Use the stable database** | Off | Make a Nightly build share the stable `dbflux.db` instead of `dbflux-nightly.db`. Applies on next launch. |

See [Data & Privacy](DATA_AND_PRIVACY.md#data-locations) for how the Nightly and
stable databases are separated.

## Audit

The Audit section controls the unified audit log. The main user-facing control
is **Log Capture → Minimum Level** (trace / debug / info / warn / error), which
sets how much of DBFlux's internal logging is folded into the audit trail. Saving
takes effect without a restart.

Retention (how long events are kept) drives a periodic background purge when
configured. For the day-to-day audit experience — opening the viewer, filtering,
exporting — see [Dashboards & Audit](DASHBOARDS_AND_AUDIT.md#audit-viewer). For
the full event schema and redaction behavior see [Audit](AUDIT.md) and
[Data & Privacy](DATA_AND_PRIVACY.md#audit-and-privacy).

---

## Keybindings

This section is a **read-only viewer**. It lists the active keymap grouped by
context, with a text filter and inline warnings when a chord is bound to more
than one command. It does **not** currently let you rebind or save custom
shortcuts from the UI. Use it to discover and verify bindings; the full default
keymap is documented in [Usage → Keyboard Reference](USAGE.md#7-keyboard-reference).

---

## Auth Profiles, Proxies, SSH Tunnels

These three sections manage the reusable profiles you then select per connection
on the Access tab. They're documented in full — fields, AWS SSO flow, no-proxy
rules, SSH auth methods — in
[Connecting to a Database → Advanced Setup](CONNECTIONS.md):

- [Auth Profiles](CONNECTIONS.md#auth-profiles-aws-sso-and-shared-credentials)
- [Proxies](CONNECTIONS.md#proxies)
- [SSH Tunnels](CONNECTIONS.md#ssh-tunnels)

Credentials entered here are stored in your OS keyring, not the database. See
[Data & Privacy → Secrets](DATA_AND_PRIVACY.md#secrets-and-the-os-keyring).

---

## Services (RPC)

External drivers and auth providers run as separate processes that DBFlux talks
to over a local socket. Each service you add here has:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Socket ID** | Unique identifier, used as the socket filename. ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-` only. |
| **Command** | The executable to launch (optional for some setups). |
| **Startup Timeout (ms)** | How long to wait for the process to come up. Default 5000. |
| **Service Type** | **Driver** or **Auth Provider**. |
| **Enable this service** | Whether the service starts. Default on. |
| **Arguments** | Ordered process arguments. |
| **Environment Variables** | `KEY=value` pairs passed to the process. |

Changes here **take effect on the next launch**. Full reference:
[RPC Services Config](RPC_SERVICES_CONFIG.md) and the
[Driver RPC Protocol](DRIVER_RPC_PROTOCOL.md).

---

## Drivers

Pick a driver to see and override its behavior. Two groups are editable:

**Global overrides** — per-driver versions of the General settings. Each is a
tri-state (Inherit / On / Off, or an explicit value); leaving it on *Inherit*
uses the General default shown next to the control:

- Refresh policy and interval
- Confirm dangerous queries
- Require WHERE
- Require preview

**Driver settings** — options defined by the driver itself (rendered generically
from the driver's own schema, so the available fields depend on the driver).

The section also shows, read-only, the driver's **capability matrix**, category,
and query language.

---

## Connection Hooks

Hooks are reusable commands, scripts, or Lua snippets that run around a
connection's lifecycle. You **define** them globally in **Settings → Hooks**, then
**bind** them to phases on individual connections in the Connection Manager's
**Hooks** tab.

### Quick path

1. **Settings → Hooks → add a hook.** Give it a **Hook ID**, pick a **Type**, and
   fill in the command/script.
2. Open a connection in the **Connection Manager → Hooks tab**.
3. Select your hook in one of the four phase dropdowns (Pre-connect, Post-connect,
   Pre-disconnect, Post-disconnect).
4. Connect. Hook output streams into the **Tasks** panel.

### Hook types

| Type | What it runs | What you provide |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **Command** | An executable | A command and space-separated arguments. |
| **Script** | A Bash or Python file | A language, a file path, and an optional interpreter override (blank = `bash` / `python3`, platform-adjusted). |
| **Lua** | An in-process Lua script | A file path and a set of capabilities (see below). Lua runs inside DBFlux — no external interpreter. |

Scripts are edited in DBFlux's editor and stored under a `hooks/` folder by
default.

#### Lua capabilities

A Lua hook only gets the abilities you enable:

| Capability | Grants |
|------------|--------|
| **Logging** | On by default; write to the hook's output. |
| **Environment read** | On by default; read environment variables. |
| **Connection metadata** | On by default; read the connecting profile's metadata. |
| **Controlled process run** | Off by default; call `dbflux.process.run(...)` to launch external processes. |

> Enabling **Controlled process run** lets the hook execute arbitrary external
> commands. DBFlux shows a security warning when it's on, both in the hook
> definition and on the per-connection binding. Enable it only for hooks you
> trust.

The embedded Lua runtime (available APIs, sandboxing) is documented in
[Lua Scripting](LUA.md).

### Hook options

| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Enabled** | Disabled hooks are skipped. |
| **Working Directory** | Process/script cwd (not used by Lua). |
| **Environment** | Extra `KEY=value` pairs. |
| **Inherit parent environment** | On by default; pass DBFlux's env to the hook. |
| **Env Denylist** | Variable names to strip from the inherited env. |
| **Timeout (ms)** | Blank = no timeout. On timeout the process group is killed. |
| **Execution mode** | **Blocking** (default) waits for the hook; **Detached** runs in the background and does not block connect/disconnect. |
| **Ready signal** (Detached) | Text DBFlux waits for in the hook's output before continuing. |
| **On Failure** | The failure policy — see below. |

DBFlux always injects context env vars into process hooks: `DBFLUX_PROFILE_ID`,
`DBFLUX_PROFILE_NAME`, `DBFLUX_DB_KIND`, and, when known, `DBFLUX_HOST`,
`DBFLUX_PORT`, `DBFLUX_DATABASE`.

> **Secrets never leak into hooks by accident.** On top of your Env Denylist,
> DBFlux always strips inherited variables whose name contains `SECRET`, `TOKEN`,
> `PASSWORD`, or `_KEY`, and any `AWS_*` variable.

### Failure policies

What happens when a hook fails (non-zero exit, timeout, or error):

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Disconnect** (default) | Abort the phase — the connect or disconnect flow stops. |
| **Warn** | Continue, but surface a warning. |
| **Ignore** | Continue; the failure is only logged. |

### Phases

| Phase | Runs |
|-------|------|
| **Pre-connect** | Before the connection opens. |
| **Post-connect** | After a successful connect. |
| **Pre-disconnect** | Before disconnecting. |
| **Post-disconnect** | After disconnecting. |

A connection's Hooks tab has one dropdown per phase (plus an "Extra" input for
binding additional hook IDs). The dropdowns list the reusable hooks you defined
in Settings → Hooks. Each hook runs as its own background task with live
stdout/stderr in the Tasks panel; output is capped at 4 MiB per hook.
